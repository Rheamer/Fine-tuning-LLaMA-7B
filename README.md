# Project Repository

This repository contains the code and resources for scraping data from Telegram channels using `scrape.ipynb` and training the LLaMA_7B model using `Pipeline.ipynb`.

## Contents

- `scrape.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook that includes the code for scraping data from Telegram channels. It utilizes the Telegram API and Python libraries to collect the required data. The notebook provides step-by-step instructions and explanations of the scraping process.

- `Pipeline.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook that contains the code for training the LLaMA_7B model. It demonstrates the pipeline for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The notebook includes detailed explanations and comments to guide the user through the training process.

## Getting Started

To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Obtain API credentials for accessing the Telegram API. Refer to the Telegram API documentation for instructions on obtaining the necessary credentials.

2. Run `scrape.ipynb` to scrape data from Telegram channels. Make sure to provide the required API credentials and specify the channels to scrape. The scraped data will be saved in the `data/` directory.

3. Run `Pipeline.ipynb` to preprocess the scraped data, train the LLaMA_7B model, and evaluate its performance. The trained model will be saved in the `models/` directory.
